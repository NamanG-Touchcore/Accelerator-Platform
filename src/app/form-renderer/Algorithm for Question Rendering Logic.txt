Algorithm for Question Rendering Logic

1. Get the response for a specific element
2. For that response, call a function that would
    a. Check if there is predicate logic
    b. If there is, then find out all the dependencies
    c. According to the response, call the function with id of the predicate response question, which would hide all the questions that are between the current question and the predicate target
    d. If there is a change in a prefilled question, then it would call a function, that would remove the hidden logic from all the questions that are there between the target question and the current question, and then follow 2c.

Internal Logic for question rendering
1. Have isHidden prop in each question element, which would be data bound
2. Have a function that would hide the question, and set the isHidden prop to true
